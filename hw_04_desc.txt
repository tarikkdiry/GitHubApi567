The main thing I thought about while writing this program was how to make it as readable as it can. Even before writing it so that it\'92s easy to test, I kept in mind how this will look and read once it is opened. Doing this will provide the easiest path to successful testing. \
\
To make it easy to test, I wrote a few if statements and one try/except statement in order to cover all errors and edge cases, both blatant and subtle. Each error return message will provide a clear clue as to where the error lies.\
\
The only real challenges I faced were completely technical. Specifically the syntax of JSON parsing and presenting in a readable way. \
